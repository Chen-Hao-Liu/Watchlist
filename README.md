# Project Watchlist
Watchlist is an Android app that allows you browse for, save, and score/review anime/manga. You can search by top overall, currently airing, upcoming, and more. If you have specific shows in mind, you can do an advanced search, adding on additional search parameters like genre, rating, etc. Add shows to your saved list by tapping on the favorite icon. Favorited shows can be given a score and a review. You can also read other user reviews!

I used the [Jikan API](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#) for this project.
